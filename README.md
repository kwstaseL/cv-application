## CV Application

Developed with React, serves as a tool for creating and downloading a CV. 

User's can:

- Input personal information, work experience, and education details.
- See real-time updates happening and experience full responsiveness.
- Edit, delete, and export their CV as a PDF file.

*While the core functionality is already in place, I am still working on refining the application. Additionally, I have plans to implement API calls for auto-filling certain information in the near future.*
